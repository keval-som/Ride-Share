How to run the application
Use: npm start

The .env provided with the code points towards the mongodb atlas cloud db. where there will be some sample rides posted for dates 17-20 December. 

The process that is generally followed is:
Driver-> post Ride -> Once rider requests a ride -> chat with driver and decide whether to accept or reject
Rider -> book a ride -> chat with driver for details -> if accepted you will receive an email saying ride is confirmed -> once the ride finishes receive a email containing the review form.  


P.S. -> When we mention the ride is finished, it means as soon as the current time passes the posted ride time, we mark it as finished and then the reviews are sent etc.
